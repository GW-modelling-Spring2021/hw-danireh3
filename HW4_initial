Nice start on this!

1. Watch your terms.  Is one really the 'negative' of the other?

2. Be careful of the 'momentum' analogy.  Think in terms of how much water is flowing.
Explain using conservation of mass.

3. Why does the flow magnitude increase to the right of the well?  What is happening
in the system there?

4. Rethink this one!

5. Check where you put your well.  Also, think about the entire flow system.  Try to
develop a sense for how water is moving throughout the domain!
